theater was chaos — ppl moving like fish in a koi pond, noisy, w me juggling my jacket and these popcorn crumbs digging into my jeans. but woah, The Woman in the Yard, wtf even was that? like one moment i’m lost in this sea of gratuitous green & THE FOG. My back is aching from the weird slopey seats and, like, gravity itself is annoyed at me.  

srsly tho, that scene where she’s just standing there, mid-garden, whispering like the wind's got secrets. It’s like watching a sunflower charm a snake — kinda beautiful yet super unsettling, ya know? and that one dude - what was his name? Orv? Ott? idk - he just HAD to exist to be wet socks incarnate. Sometimes life feels like a soggy Wednesday umbrella, not broken but somehow still uselessly flopping around.

> This lunch bag of popcorn is just— like, who even decides it’s just THAT salty? Parallels, man. The saltiness is the movie’s sadness; you can’t escape it any way you crunch in. Still found some popcorn in my dang shoe after I left - pretty much exactly like the leftover tension brewing throughout the movie, ya know?

oH shoot wait, remember to download the movie? thought about how I’d make sense of certain scenes ‘cause I might need to watch the movie again — that lady’s stare when she finds out the bird’s gone? CRYPTIC AS AN ETCH-A-SKETCH SCREAMING FOR ATTENTION.

And the sound. Imagine a chorus of clashing forks, somehow turning into a gentle wave when you least expect it. I think I heard that one creaky staircase vibe and there was someone behind me coughing in time to it - like a reluctant percussionist audition.

Why was—or maybe I’m nuts—there suddenly a goat? I mean, one moment deep poetry, and the next, BAM, goat. Stand there with the same gravitas like it was Aristotle reincarnate, bleating truths.

Honestly, still wondering if my brain overheated? Did I even vent properly to you? Anyway, gfuhgf49725%5’r3fbwe
